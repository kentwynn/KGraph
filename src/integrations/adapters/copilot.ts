  instructions: `## KGraph Workflow

1. **Before exploring the repository**, run \`kgraph context "<topic>"\` to load existing repo intelligence. Use the returned files, symbols, and cognition before any broad exploration.
2. **After completing work**, write a Markdown note to \`.kgraph/inbox/<slug>.md\` **only if** you discovered something a future session would need to re-derive — a gotcha, architectural constraint, non-obvious decision, or bug. For routine or read-only sessions where nothing new was found, skip capture entirely. When you do capture, immediately run \`kgraph update\`.
3. If you created, moved, deleted, or renamed files or symbols, run \`kgraph scan\`.

The inbox note must use this structure:
\`\`\`markdown
# <Short Title>

## Summary
One or two sentences describing what was done.

## Key Files
- \`path/to/file.ts\` — what it does

## Key Symbols
- \`FunctionName\` — what it does

## Decisions
Any architectural or implementation decisions made.
