1. Before exploring the repository, run \`kgraph context "<topic>"\` to load existing repo intelligence.
2. Use the returned files, symbols, relationships, and cognition before broad exploration.
3. After durable discoveries (architecture decisions, debugging insights, structural findings), write a concise Markdown note to \`.kgraph/inbox/\` and immediately run \`kgraph update\`.
4. If you created, moved, deleted, or renamed files or symbols, run \`kgraph scan\`.
5. Use /kgraph-scan, /kgraph-update, /kgraph-visualize, and /kgraph-history for manual maintenance steps.
